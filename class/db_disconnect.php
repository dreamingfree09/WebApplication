<?php
// db_disconnect.php

// Check if the database connection exists and is valid
if (isset($dbConnect) && $dbConnect) {
    // Close the database connection
    $dbConnect->close();
}

// Explanation:
// - This script is responsible for closing the database connection if it exists.
// - It checks if the $dbConnect variable is set and valid (not null).
// - If the connection is valid, it closes the connection using the 'close' method.
// - Closing the database connection is important to release resources when they are no longer needed.
// - Did not manage to implement as there was a lack of time due to server application default misconfiguration. By the moment the issue was fixed there was not sufficient time to implement. Based on research php ends the script automatically in most cases.
